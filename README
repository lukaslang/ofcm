3. Requirements

This software was originally written for and tested with Matlab R2015a.

The following libraries are required for parts of this sofware:

xUnit: used for testing.
URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22846-matlab-xunit-test-framework 

export_fig: used for producing high quality figures from the results.
URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-exportfig

The following libraries are already included in the folder 'external':

imgaussian: used for fast Gaussian filtering of 3D data.
URL: http://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25397-imgaussian

tiffread.m: used for reading LSM microscopy data files.
URL: http://www.cytosim.org/misc/index.html

lgwt: used for computing Legendre-Gauss quadrature weights and nodes.
URL: https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4540-legendre-gauss-quadrature-weights-and-nodes

Moreover, it requires the code of OFD (Decomposition of Optical Flow on the Sphere).

Moreover, it requires the code of OFISH (Optical Flow on Evolving Sphere-Like Surfaces).

4. Usage

For easier use we provide a startup script (startup.m), which sets up the 
Matlab search path. It includes required libraries and adds required 
subdirectories. Make sure to download the required packages and to set the 
library paths properly. Then simply run the startup script.

To run the test cases execute

>> runtests test

or

>> runtests test -verbose

to get more information (see xUnit for more information).

In order to run the software with real data set the path to your LSM files
in the script:

- ofdm_datapath.m.

The following run scripts are included:

- runofdmp.m (computes the optical flow on evolving sphere-like surfaces)
- runcm.m (computes the mass conservation-based velocity on evolving sphere-like surfaces)

For faster processing we recommend compiling the imgaussian.c script:

>> cd external
>> cd imgaussian
>> mex imgaussian.c

Make sure Matlab has rights to execute the imgaussian.mexw* file!
